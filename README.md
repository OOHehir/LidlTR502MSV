# Lidl TR-502MSV

Connects Lidl TR502MSV/ RC-710 remote controlled sockets to Homey

This app is a port from https://github.com/athombv/nl.aldi
Yet to implement:
* The dimmer socket (RC-710DX) as it's triac based & appears to perform poorly with all devices except incandescent lamps.
* DIM/ Bright
* All off/ all on

If anyone wishes to contribute or improve please feel free!
